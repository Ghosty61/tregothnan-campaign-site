TREGOTHNAN TEA JAPAN OPENS SEED FUNDING ROUND TO BRING BRITAIN’S ONLY HOMEGROWN TEA TO SOUTHEAST ASIA

Tokyo, Japan – Tregothnan Tea Japan, the exclusive importer and brand partner for Tregothnan Estate tea in the Japanese market, has opened a new seed investment round to scale its digital operations, expand its product lines, and enter the Southeast Asian market in 2025.

Since launching in 2019 with debut sales at Mitsukoshi department stores in Tokyo, the company has grown a loyal customer base through a blend of British heritage and Japanese refinement. Their offerings include rare estate blends from Cornwall, including the limited-edition “Majestea” – featuring tea leaves planted by King Charles III.

“British-grown tea is one of the rarest products in the global tea market,” said [Your Name], founder of Tregothnan Tea Japan. “We’ve already seen strong resonance with Japanese customers and are now preparing to take that story across Asia.”

The company is seeking £25,000–£65,000 in seed funding, supported by a pending 50% match-funding grant from Cornwall Growth Hub. The raise will be used to integrate new sales channels, scale packaging and stock, and expand digital marketing across LINE and TikTok.

Tregothnan Tea Japan also introduced its illustrated character Hana-chan – a cultural bridge between British and Japanese audiences – who appears on gift packaging and digital campaigns. She is part of the company’s brand IP and storytelling strategy.
